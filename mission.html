      <p>No living being on Earth can survive without water. Not only does water regulate the Earth's temperature, but it is also vital in order for humans to carry out essential bodily functions. However, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, nearly 97% of the world’s water is salty or otherwise undrinkable. Another 2% is locked in ice caps and glaciers. That leaves just 1% for all of humanity’s needs — all its agricultural, residential, manufacturing, community, and personal needs.</p>

      <p> So, what can humanity do about this problem? Well, we say shut your taps! We strive to raise awareness about the lack of drinking water that is a part of daily life for billions of people. Use our water usage tracker to check how many liters of water you use on a daily basis, while keeping in mind the tips we have on saving water in daily activities. Also check out the links to organizations that you can get into contact with to help us all put an end to the water crisis, one drop at a time.
